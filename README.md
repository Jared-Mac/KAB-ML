## General Information
- Create a machine learning algorithm that is able to receive Google Street images, and return the results. The results are
  an google streat image with the litter found marked in it. Also, it will show the confidence/accurray in the google street image. Additonally, a json   
  file that textualize the amount litter found in the pictures.
  
- The user will connect to the machine lerning algorithm with a TCP connection through Socket Programming develop in Python language.
  
<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->


## Requirements
- Open the Deep Learning VM Deployment Page in the GCP Marketplace( We selected the n1-highmem-4 which utilized 4 vCPUs and includes 26 GB memory) 
- Add a GPU, the NVIDIA Tesla T4 is the least expensive option and will work for our needs. 
- Verify “Install NVIDIA GPU driver automatically on first startup?” is selected. 
  (A minimum 150 GB persistent boot disk size should be selected,   however more would be better depending on the dataset being used and how much   
   information you plan on working on at once)

- git clone https://github.com/SushiTeam2022/KAAB-ML/tree/main/YOLOv5   # clone
- cd yolov5
- pip install -r requirements.txt  #install
