# What to do with these files?
Firstly, copy the KABML_server.py code, and the best415.pt weights, into the [YOLOv5 folder](https://github.com/SushiTeam2022/KAAB-ML/tree/main/YOLOv5).

As for the KABML_client.py code, that can placed anywhere of your choosing.

Once this is done, follow the TCP-Detection Manual.pdf in the Documentation folder.
